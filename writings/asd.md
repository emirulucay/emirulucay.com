The school was open 3 weeks ago. I was very difficult to get used to the school though my last year in high school. I don't know why, but i don't wanna go to it. Already I'm not thinking to go to university in this year. I'm not sure for I got truth decide, but I made my plan in start of summer and I applied that along 3 months. So I don't wanna give up.

I have so much works I will do according to my plan. First I wanna publish my friend Yahya's website. He will publish 3d models on her website. Already I completed a major part. After then I'm planning to change somethings on my website. You are probably reading this writings on updated version. Already I will change only code structure. Except these I wanna design website to my familiar persons have content like Yahya. I think this idea is perfect chance to prove myself.

Except work and school, my social activities is a so little. We played football with my friends and some my teachers last weekend. I did some mistakes in game but the game was enough fun. Our sport teacher said to we were playing bad. But that is we don't care. We just fun.

Anyway, I continues my works in general. I hope I have success.
